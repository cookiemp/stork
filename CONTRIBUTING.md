# Contributing to Stork P2P

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Stork P2P! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter**: Version 3.32.8 or later
- **Dart**: Version 3.10.7 or later  
- **Visual Studio Build Tools**: 2019 or later (for Windows development)
- **Git**: For version control

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stork-p2p.git
   cd stork-p2p
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. **Verify setup**:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   flutter analyze
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Development Workflow

### Code Style

- **Follow Dart/Flutter conventions**: Use `dart format` and `flutter analyze`
- **Material Design 3**: Follow Material 3 design principles for UI
- **Comments**: Document complex logic and public APIs
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, camelCase names for variables and methods

### Architecture Guidelines

- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic goes in `lib/services/`
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintain separation between UI, services, and models
- **Error Handling**: Use comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Security First**: All new features should consider security implications

### Branch Strategy

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/**: Feature development branches
- **bugfix/**: Bug fix branches
- **hotfix/**: Critical production fixes

Example branch naming:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/android-support
git checkout -b bugfix/file-transfer-timeout
git checkout -b hotfix/security-vulnerability
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all Flutter tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/services/security_manager_test.dart

# Run integration tests
flutter test integration_test/

# Test coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### Test Requirements

- **Unit tests** for all services and utilities
- **Widget tests** for custom widgets and screens
- **Integration tests** for critical user flows
- **Security tests** for encryption and authentication features

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test core services
dart run test_core_services.dart

# Test security features
dart run test_phase4_security.dart

# Test file transfers
dart run test_receiver.dart
```

## üìù Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "feat(security): add biometric authentication support"
git commit -m "fix(transfer): resolve file corruption on large transfers"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Security-Related Changes

- **Encryption**: Changes to encryption must maintain AES-256-GCM standard
- **Authentication**: PIN and biometric features require thorough testing
- **Key Management**: RSA-2048 minimum for key exchange
- **Privacy**: Ensure no sensitive data is logged or stored unnecessarily

### Reporting Security Issues

Please **DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead:
1. Email security issues to: [security@stork-p2p.com]
2. Include detailed description and reproduction steps
3. Allow reasonable time for fix before public disclosure
