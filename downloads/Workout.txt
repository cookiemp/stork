The Gainz Method: (how to actually make progress in the gym)

Most people lift weights,
few get stronger every week.

This is how to make sure you’re making progress consistently:

For every exercise,
1. Pick a rep range — 8 to 12 is great.
2. Choose a weight you can only hit for 8 reps. Not 9. Not 10. Just 8.
3. Each week, try to add a rep.
Hit 9… then 10… all the way to 12.
4. Once 12 is clean and controlled, add more weight and go back to 8 reps.
5. Repeat the cycle. Forever.

That’s progressive overload.
That’s what builds muscle.
