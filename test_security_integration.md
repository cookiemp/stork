# Security Integration Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides instructions for testing the security integration features that were added to the Stork P2P file transfer application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. PendingTransfer Model
- Added `PendingTransfer` class to `lib/services/receiver_service.dart`
- Supports pending transfer states: `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`
- Tracks transfer metadata: ID, filename, size, sender info, timestamp

### 2. Security Integration Methods
- `setSecurityManager(SecurityManager)` - Injects security manager into receiver service
- `_requiresApproval(String, int, String)` - Checks if a transfer needs approval
- `_requestApproval(PendingTransfer)` - Requests approval for a pending transfer

### 3. Security Initialization Flow
- Updated `main.dart` to inject SecurityManager into ReceiverService after initialization
- Maintains backward compatibility when security is not available

## Test Files Created

### Unit Tests
- `test/services/security_integration_test.dart` - Tests core security integration
- `test/services/security_approval_workflow_test.dart` - Tests approval workflow

### Integration Tests
- `test/integration/security_initialization_test.dart` - Tests initialization flow

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure Flutter is installed and available in your PATH
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd C:\Users\shime\OneDrive\Desktop\Code\Stork\stork2`

### Test Commands

#### Run All Security Integration Tests
```bash
flutter test test/services/security_integration_test.dart
```

#### Run Security Approval Workflow Tests
```bash
flutter test test/services/security_approval_workflow_test.dart
```

#### Run Security Initialization Integration Tests
```bash
flutter test test/integration/security_initialization_test.dart
```

#### Run All Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

#### Run Tests with Verbose Output
```bash
flutter test --verbose
```

## Expected Test Results

### Security Integration Tests
- ✅ SecurityManager injection into ReceiverService
- ✅ PendingTransfer model creation and validation
- ✅ Enum values and state management
- ✅ Edge cases and error handling

### Security Approval Workflow Tests
- ✅ Approval requirement logic (large files, unknown senders)
- ✅ Approval request processing
- ✅ Complete workflow integration
- ✅ Transfer state transitions

### Security Initialization Tests
- ✅ Proper initialization order
- ✅ Graceful handling of security initialization failure
- ✅ Widget integration and UI elements
- ✅ Service lifecycle management

## Manual Testing

### 1. App Launch with Security
1. Launch the app
2. Verify the security icon appears in the app bar (if security initialized successfully)
3. Check console output for security initialization messages

### 2. File Transfer with Security
1. Start the receiver service
2. Send a file to the receiver
3. If security is enabled, check that appropriate approval flows are triggered
4. Verify transfer history records security-related events

### 3. Security Settings
1. Tap the security icon in the app bar (if available)
2. Verify security settings screen opens
3. Test PIN setup and verification flows

## Troubleshooting

### Test Failures
- **Security initialization fails**: This is expected in test environments without proper platform support
- **Widget tests fail**: Ensure all dependencies are properly mocked
- **Integration tests timeout**: Some async operations may need longer timeouts

### Common Issues
1. **Flutter not found**: Install Flutter SDK and add to PATH
2. **Missing dependencies**: Run `flutter pub get`
3. **Platform-specific failures**: Some security features require real devices

## Test Coverage

The tests cover:
- ✅ Security manager injection and lifecycle
- ✅ PendingTransfer model functionality
- ✅ Approval workflow logic
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ Integration with main app flow
- ✅ Widget and UI integration

## Security Features Verification

To verify the security integration works correctly:

1. **Injection Works**: SecurityManager is properly injected into ReceiverService
2. **Approval Logic**: Files requiring approval are correctly identified
3. **State Management**: PendingTransfer objects maintain proper state
4. **Backward Compatibility**: App works without security features
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when security fails

## Next Steps

After running tests:
1. Address any failing tests
2. Add additional test scenarios as needed
3. Test on real devices with security hardware
4. Implement actual approval UI components
5. Add end-to-end security flow tests

## Notes

- Tests use mock implementations where private methods cannot be directly tested
- Some platform-specific security features may not work in test environments
- The security integration is designed to be non-breaking and backward compatible
